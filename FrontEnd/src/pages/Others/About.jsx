                        While our AI Resume Mailer App offers a significant improvement in streamlining job application emails, there are some current limitations:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2">

                            <li><strong>Single Mail Sender Issue:</strong> Currently, all emails are sent from a single, fixed email address integrated on the backend. This means that users cannot send emails from their personal or login email addresses. All outgoing emails will show the same sender, which may reduce personalization and user control.</li>
                        </div>
                        <li><strong>Email Personalization:</strong> The AI-generated content may not fully capture specific experiences or nuanced roles, which may require additional manual edits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Email Delivery Reliability:</strong> The email delivery system depends on third-party servers, which could occasionally impact successful email delivery.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Although user data is secured, there are ongoing efforts to ensure end-to-end encryption and enhance data protection.</li>
                        <li><strong>AI Limitations:</strong> The ChatGPT integration, while powerful, may sometimes produce generic responses that may not align perfectly with all job applications.</li>
